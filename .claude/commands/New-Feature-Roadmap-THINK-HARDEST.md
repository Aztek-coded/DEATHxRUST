# Task: Create Discord Bot Feature Implementation Roadmap (THINK HARDEST)

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Feature Details**: Review the provided command name, intended functionality, and any Discord-specific behaviors. Identify core requirements, user interactions (slash commands, messages, embeds), event flows, and integration points with existing bot modules.

2. **Analyze Development Guidelines**: Study the Rust Discord bot guidelines. Ensure all steps align with Poise framework patterns, async/await handling, error management, and project architecture standards.

3. **Analyze Required Reference Files**: Examine listed filepaths, modules, command handlers, and code patterns. Map them to the feature to identify reuse opportunities (e.g., existing command patterns, utility functions, data structures).

4. **Analyze Optional Reference Files (if necessary)**: Only if required for clarity, review additional modules or dependencies. Justify usage in analysis.

5. **Perform Implementation Analysis**:
   - Hypothesize approaches: Break down into command handlers, event processors, data models, and Discord API interactions
   - Trace from Discord events to bot responses: E.g., slash command → parse arguments → execute logic → send embed/message
   - Consider async execution, rate limits, permissions, and error handling
   - Prioritize modular changes following the bot's module structure

6. **Develop Roadmap Strategy**:
   - Think deeply about Discord bot patterns and Poise framework requirements
   - Outline step-by-step implementation: 
     - Specify modules, commands, handlers to modify/add (e.g., `src/commands/new_feature.rs`)
     - Git branch creation (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/music-commands`)
     - Logging additions using `tracing` (where, what to log: e.g., command invocations, API responses, errors)
   - Include verification via bot logging and Discord interactions

7. **Identify Key Changes**:
   - Summarize main updates: E.g., new command module, event handler, data structures for Discord entities
   - Consider command registration, permissions, and guild vs global deployment
   - Prioritize based on impact and Discord API constraints

8. **Output Roadmap Plan**:
   - Create a markdown file in the `/Users/aztek/Desktop/DEATHxRUST/.claude/roadmaps` directory
   - Include: 
     - Feature/command summary
     - Discord interaction flow analysis
     - Explicit modules/commands/handlers with filepaths
     - Branch details
     - Logging specifications using `tracing`
     - Hypothesized implementation approaches
     - Step-by-step roadmap with Poise/Serenity considerations
   - Do not implement code or logic
   - Ensure plan follows Rust async patterns and Discord bot best practices

## Feature Details:

### Name:
**Command Response Tester**

### Intended Function/Feature:
A development tool command that programmatically tests and displays all possible response types from any given command in the bot. This tool will:
- Generate and display all response variations (success, error, warning, info, help) for a specified command
- Validate that response colors align with the development guidelines (defined in `EmbedColor`)
- Ensure response messages are concise and not overly verbose
- Provide a unified view of all response types for consistency checking
- Support both slash commands and prefix commands testing
- Enable developers to quickly audit response consistency across the entire command suite

### Symptoms/Behaviors (if update):
Currently, there is no systematic way to:
- View all response types from a command in one place
- Verify color consistency across different response types
- Check message verbosity and formatting consistency
- Test error conditions without manually triggering them
- Ensure all commands follow the established response guidelines

### Expected Outcomes:
1. **New `/test-responses` command** that accepts a command name as parameter
2. **Comprehensive response display** showing:
   - Success response (green - 0x62CB77)
   - Error response (dark red - 0x853535)
   - Warning/Help response (yellow - 0xFFE209)
   - Info response (yellow - 0xFFE209)
   - Primary response (beige/tan - 0xC6AC80)
3. **Validation report** indicating:
   - Color alignment with guidelines
   - Message length/verbosity metrics
   - Consistency checks across response types
4. **Mock context creation** to simulate various command scenarios without side effects
5. **Response audit trail** documenting which commands have been tested and their compliance status
A comprehensive command system for Discord server boosters and administrators to manage custom booster roles. The feature enables:

1. **Custom Color Roles** - Allow boosters to create personalized color roles with custom names
2. **Role Linking** - Administrators can link existing roles to function as booster roles
3. **Content Filtering** - Administrators can blacklist inappropriate words for role names
4. **Management Tools** - View and manage all booster roles in the server

**Command Structure:**
- `/boosterrole color [color] [second_color] [name]` - Create custom color role (Booster only)
- `/boosterrole link [member] [role]` - Link role to booster (Manage Guild permission)
- `/boosterrole filter [word]` - Add word to blacklist (Manage Guild permission)
- `/boosterrole filter list` - View blacklisted words (Manage Guild permission)
- `/boosterrole list` - View all booster roles (Manage Guild permission)

### Symptoms/Behaviors (if update):
*New feature implementation - N/A*

### Expected Outcomes:
- **For Boosters:**
  - Create custom color roles with personalized names
  - Choose primary and secondary colors for their role
  - Enhanced server personalization experience
  - Automatic role management tied to boost status

- **For Administrators:**
  - Link existing roles to boosters without creating new ones
  - Filter inappropriate role names through word blacklist
  - View comprehensive list of all booster roles for management
  - Maintain server standards through content filtering
  - Delegate role management while maintaining control

- **Technical Implementation:**
  - 5 slash commands with subcommand group structure
  - Permission-based access control (Booster-only and Manage Guild permissions)
  - Persistent data storage for booster roles, filters, and links
  - Color validation and parsing with hex/RGB support
  - Role hierarchy validation and management
  - Automatic cleanup when boost expires
  - Rate limiting for role creation
  - Embed-based responses for better UX

- **Discord API Interactions:**
  - Role creation with color values
  - Member role assignment/removal
  - Permission checking for command execution
  - Guild boost status verification
  - Role position management in hierarchy
