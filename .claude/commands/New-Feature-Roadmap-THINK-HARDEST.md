# Task: Create Discord Bot Feature Implementation Roadmap (THINK HARDEST)

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Feature Details**: Review the provided command name, intended functionality, and any Discord-specific behaviors. Identify core requirements, user interactions (slash commands, messages, embeds), event flows, and integration points with existing bot modules.

2. **Analyze Development Guidelines**: Study the Rust Discord bot guidelines. Ensure all steps align with Poise framework patterns, async/await handling, error management, and project architecture standards.

3. **Analyze Required Reference Files**: Examine listed filepaths, modules, command handlers, and code patterns. Map them to the feature to identify reuse opportunities (e.g., existing command patterns, utility functions, data structures).

4. **Analyze Optional Reference Files (if necessary)**: Only if required for clarity, review additional modules or dependencies. Justify usage in analysis.

5. **Perform Implementation Analysis**:
   - Hypothesize approaches: Break down into command handlers, event processors, data models, and Discord API interactions
   - Trace from Discord events to bot responses: E.g., slash command → parse arguments → execute logic → send embed/message
   - Consider async execution, rate limits, permissions, and error handling
   - Prioritize modular changes following the bot's module structure

6. **Develop Roadmap Strategy**:
   - Think deeply about Discord bot patterns and Poise framework requirements
   - Outline step-by-step implementation: 
     - Specify modules, commands, handlers to modify/add (e.g., `src/commands/new_feature.rs`)
     - Git branch creation (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/music-commands`)
     - Logging additions using `tracing` (where, what to log: e.g., command invocations, API responses, errors)
   - Include verification via bot logging and Discord interactions

7. **Identify Key Changes**:
   - Summarize main updates: E.g., new command module, event handler, data structures for Discord entities
   - Consider command registration, permissions, and guild vs global deployment
   - Prioritize based on impact and Discord API constraints

8. **Output Roadmap Plan**:
   - Create a markdown file in the `/Users/aztek/Desktop/DEATHxRUST/.claude/roadmaps` directory
   - Include: 
     - Feature/command summary
     - Discord interaction flow analysis
     - Explicit modules/commands/handlers with filepaths
     - Branch details
     - Logging specifications using `tracing`
     - Hypothesized implementation approaches
     - Step-by-step roadmap with Poise/Serenity considerations
   - Do not implement code or logic
   - Ensure plan follows Rust async patterns and Discord bot best practices

## Feature Details:

### Name:
**Boosterrole Extended Management Commands**

### Intended Function/Feature:
A comprehensive suite of additional boosterrole management commands that extend the existing boosterrole functionality with administrative controls and enhanced user customization options:

1. **Cleanup System** - Automated removal of unused/orphaned booster roles
2. **Role Limits** - Server-wide limits on booster role creation
3. **Role Renaming** - Allow boosters to rename their existing roles
4. **Award System** - Automatic role rewards upon member boosting with management controls

**Command Structure:**
- `/boosterrole cleanup` - Clean up unused booster roles (Manage Guild permission)
- `/boosterrole limit [limit]` - Set limit for booster roles (Manage Guild permission)
- `/boosterrole rename [new_name]` - Edit your booster role's name (Booster only)
- `/boosterrole award [role]` - Reward a member a specific role upon boost (Manage Guild, Manage Roles permissions)
- `/boosterrole award unset` - Remove the reward role (Manage Guild, Manage Roles permissions)
- `/boosterrole award view` - View the current award role (Manage Guild, Manage Roles permissions)

### Symptoms/Behaviors (if update):
Currently missing essential management features for booster roles:
- No automated cleanup for roles when boosters leave or expire
- No limits on role creation leading to potential abuse
- No way for boosters to rename their existing roles
- No automatic reward system for new boosters
- Manual role management required by administrators
- Orphaned roles accumulate over time cluttering the role list

### Expected Outcomes:
1. **Automated Maintenance**: 
   - `/boosterrole cleanup` removes orphaned roles automatically
   - Provides cleanup statistics (roles removed, members affected)
   - Dry-run option to preview changes before execution

2. **Resource Control**: 
   - `/boosterrole limit` prevents role spam with configurable limits
   - Per-guild limit storage and enforcement
   - Clear error messages when limits are reached

3. **User Flexibility**: 
   - `/boosterrole rename` empowers boosters to update their role names
   - Name validation against existing filters
   - Preserves role color and position while updating name

4. **Reward Automation**: 
   - `/boosterrole award` system automatically assigns predefined roles to new boosters
   - Event-driven role assignment on boost detection
   - Unset and view subcommands for full management control

5. **Administrative Visibility**: 
   - Clear management views for award roles and cleanup statistics
   - Audit logging for all administrative actions
   - Embedded responses with role counts and member listings

6. **Permission Enforcement**: 
   - Proper separation between booster-only and admin-only commands
   - Granular permission checks for role management operations
   - Error handling for insufficient permissions

7. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Database schema for limits and award role configuration
   - Event handlers for boost status changes
   - Batch processing for cleanup operations
   - Transaction support for atomic role operations
   - Rate limiting on rename operations
