# Task: Create Discord Bot Feature Implementation Roadmap (THINK HARDEST)

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Feature Details**: Review the provided command name, intended functionality, and any Discord-specific behaviors. Identify core requirements, user interactions (slash commands, messages, embeds), event flows, and integration points with existing bot modules.

2. **Analyze Development Guidelines**: Study the Rust Discord bot guidelines. Ensure all steps align with Poise framework patterns, async/await handling, error management, and project architecture standards.

3. **Analyze Required Reference Files**: Examine listed filepaths, modules, command handlers, and code patterns. Map them to the feature to identify reuse opportunities (e.g., existing command patterns, utility functions, data structures).

4. **Analyze Optional Reference Files (if necessary)**: Only if required for clarity, review additional modules or dependencies. Justify usage in analysis.

5. **Perform Implementation Analysis**:
   - Hypothesize approaches: Break down into command handlers, event processors, data models, and Discord API interactions
   - Trace from Discord events to bot responses: E.g., slash command → parse arguments → execute logic → send embed/message
   - Consider async execution, rate limits, permissions, and error handling
   - Prioritize modular changes following the bot's module structure

6. **Develop Roadmap Strategy**:
   - Think deeply about Discord bot patterns and Poise framework requirements
   - Outline step-by-step implementation: 
     - Specify modules, commands, handlers to modify/add (e.g., `src/commands/new_feature.rs`)
     - Git branch creation (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/music-commands`)
     - Logging additions using `tracing` (where, what to log: e.g., command invocations, API responses, errors)
   - Include verification via bot logging and Discord interactions

7. **Identify Key Changes**:
   - Summarize main updates: E.g., new command module, event handler, data structures for Discord entities
   - Consider command registration, permissions, and guild vs global deployment
   - Prioritize based on impact and Discord API constraints

8. **Output Roadmap Plan**:
   - Create a markdown file in the `/Users/aztek/Desktop/DEATHxRUST/.claude/roadmaps` directory
   - Include: 
     - Feature/command summary
     - Discord interaction flow analysis
     - Explicit modules/commands/handlers with filepaths
     - Branch details
     - Logging specifications using `tracing`
     - Hypothesized implementation approaches
     - Step-by-step roadmap with Poise/Serenity considerations
   - Do not implement code or logic
   - Ensure plan follows Rust async patterns and Discord bot best practices

## Feature Details:

### Name:
**Settings Command Suite - Comprehensive Guild Configuration System**

### Intended Function/Feature:
A complete server administration system that provides Discord server owners and administrators with granular control over guild settings through organized command groups. The system includes:

**Core Configuration Management:**
- Parent `settings` command providing overview of all guild settings
- `settings config` for viewing current configuration state

**Staff Management:**
- `settings staff <role>` for designating staff roles
- `settings staff list` for viewing all configured staff roles

**Advanced Guild Features:**
- `settings autonick <nickname>` for automatic nickname assignment to new members
- `settings joinlogs <channel>` for member join/leave event logging
- `settings premiumrole <role>` for server subscription premium member designation

The system is designed with a two-tier implementation approach: high-priority easily implementable features and medium-priority features requiring new database tables and event handlers.

### Symptoms/Behaviors (if update):
*N/A - This is a new feature implementation rather than an update to existing functionality.*

### Expected Outcomes:
1. **Administrative Control**: Server owners gain comprehensive control over guild behavior and member management
2. **Database Integration**: New tables (`guild_staff_roles`, `guild_auto_nicknames`, `guild_join_log_channels`, `guild_premium_roles`) will be created to persist settings
3. **Event Handler Integration**: Member join/leave events will trigger configured behaviors (auto-nickname, join logs)
4. **Permission-Based Access**: All commands restricted to users with "Manage Guild" permissions
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Foundation for future guild configuration features
6. **User Experience**: Intuitive command hierarchy with clear feedback and error handling
