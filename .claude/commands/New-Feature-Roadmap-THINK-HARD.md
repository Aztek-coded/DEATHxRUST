# Task: Create Discord Bot Feature Implementation Roadmap (THINK HARD)

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Feature Details**: Review the provided command name, intended functionality, and any Discord-specific behaviors. Identify core requirements, user interactions (slash commands, messages, embeds), event flows, and integration points with existing bot modules.

2. **Analyze Development Guidelines**: Study the Rust Discord bot guidelines. Ensure all steps align with Poise framework patterns, async/await handling, error management, and project architecture standards.

3. **Analyze Required Reference Files**: Examine listed filepaths, modules, command handlers, and code patterns. Map them to the feature to identify reuse opportunities (e.g., existing command patterns, utility functions, data structures).

4. **Analyze Optional Reference Files (if necessary)**: Only if required for clarity, review additional modules or dependencies. Justify usage in analysis.

5. **Perform Implementation Analysis**:
   - Hypothesize approaches: Break down into command handlers, event processors, data models, and Discord API interactions
   - Trace from Discord events to bot responses: E.g., slash command → parse arguments → execute logic → send embed/message
   - Consider async execution, rate limits, permissions, and error handling
   - Prioritize modular changes following the bot's module structure

6. **Develop Roadmap Strategy**:
   - Think deeply about Discord bot patterns and Poise framework requirements
   - Outline step-by-step implementation: 
     - Specify modules, commands, handlers to modify/add (e.g., `src/commands/new_feature.rs`)
     - Git branch creation (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/music-commands`)
     - Logging additions using `tracing` (where, what to log: e.g., command invocations, API responses, errors)
   - Include verification via bot logging and Discord interactions

7. **Identify Key Changes**:
   - Summarize main updates: E.g., new command module, event handler, data structures for Discord entities
   - Consider command registration, permissions, and guild vs global deployment
   - Prioritize based on impact and Discord API constraints

8. **Output Roadmap Plan**:
   - Create a markdown file in the `/Users/aztek/Desktop/DEATHxRUST/.claude/roadmaps` directory
   - Include: 
     - Feature/command summary
     - Discord interaction flow analysis
     - Explicit modules/commands/handlers with filepaths
     - Branch details
     - Logging specifications using `tracing`
     - Hypothesized implementation approaches
     - Step-by-step roadmap with Poise/Serenity considerations
   - Do not implement code or logic
   - Ensure plan follows Rust async patterns and Discord bot best practices

## Feature Details:

### Name:
**Typing Indicator for Prefix Commands**

### Intended Function/Feature:
Implement a high-level function that triggers Discord's typing indicator ("{bot name} is typing...") when prefix commands are being executed. This should be integrated at the Poise framework level to automatically show typing feedback for all prefix commands without requiring individual command modifications.

### Symptoms/Behaviors (if update):
N/A - New Feature

### Expected Outcomes:
- Users will see a typing indicator in the channel when the bot is processing prefix commands
- Provides immediate visual feedback that the command has been received and is being executed
- Improves user experience by indicating the bot is responsive and working
- Should work automatically for all existing and future prefix commands
- Typing indicator should appear immediately when prefix command execution begins
- Typing indicator should disappear when command execution completes or fails
