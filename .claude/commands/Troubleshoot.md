# Task: Troubleshoot Discord Bot Issue

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the Issue Report**: Review the provided issue report in detail. Identify symptoms specific to Discord bot behavior, command failures, event handling issues, or Discord API errors. Note expected vs. actual bot responses.

2. **Analyze Bot Logs (if applicable)**: Examine logs from `tracing` output, Discord gateway events, and command invocations. Look for:
   - Async/await errors and panics
   - Discord API rate limits or permission errors
   - Serenity/Poise framework errors
   - Connection/websocket issues
   - Command registration failures

3. **Analyze Reference Files (if applicable)**: Study the provided modules, command handlers, event processors. Map them to the issue and trace through:
   - Command execution flow (slash command → handler → response)
   - Event processing pipeline
   - Data flow through async functions
   - Error propagation through Result types

4. **Perform Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: 
   - Consider Discord-specific issues: permissions, intents, rate limits, API changes
   - Trace async execution paths and potential race conditions
   - Check Poise context handling and command registration
   - Analyze error handling and Result unwrapping
   - Consider guild vs. global command deployment issues

5. **Implement Debugging Strategy**:
   - Add `tracing` instrumentation at key points (command entry, API calls, event handlers)
   - Use `RUST_LOG` environment variable for debug output levels
   - Leverage Rust debugging tools (rust-gdb, lldb, or IDE debuggers)
   - Include enhanced logging: Specify modules/functions, use `tracing::{debug, info, warn, error}` macros
   - Test bot behavior in development guild before global deployment
   - Validate Discord token and permissions

6. **Identify Key Issue to Fix**:
   - Summarize the most likely root cause in Discord bot context
   - Consider if issue is: command-specific, event-related, permission-based, or framework configuration
   - Prioritize fixes based on user impact and bot stability

7. **Output Resolution Plan**:
   - Create a markdown file in `/Users/aztek/Desktop/DEATHxRUST/.claude/resolutions` directory
   - Include: 
     - Explicit module paths and functions (e.g., `src/commands/music.rs::play_command()`)
     - Branch creation: `git checkout -b fix/command-timeout`
     - Tracing/logging additions with specific levels and messages
     - RCA summary with Discord bot context
     - Step-by-step debugging approach
     - Key fixes described (not implemented)
   - Do not update any code or logic
   - Ensure resolution follows Rust async patterns and Discord bot best practices
